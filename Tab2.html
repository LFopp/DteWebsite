       <font size='5' face='' color='White'>Considering these factors and knowing that schools are relatively clean and well-maintained institutions, you wonder how littering is still an issue in schools. Here are some reasons why:
</font>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size='5' face='' color='White'>- Lack of trash bins</font>
      <br>
      <br>
       <font size='5' face='' color='White'>- Cleanliness of the site</font>
       <br>
       <br>
      <font size='5' face='' color='White'>- The behaviour of other people in the area</font>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size='5' face='' color='White'>- If people can be seen littering</font>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size='5' face='' color='White'> - Lack of information – Students litter because they don’t comprehend the gravity of the impact that litter causes.
      </font>
      <br>
      <br>
       <font size='5' face='' color='White'> - Presence of litter – Students are likelier to throw in unclean sites because there’s already litter in the area.
      </font>
      <br>
      <br>
        <font size='5' face='' color='White'> - Laziness – Students litter is because they’re too lazy to look for trash bins, and throwing trash anywhere is more convenient.
      </font>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size='5' face='' color='White'>- Lax execution of rules on littering – people disregard rules when they are not imposed well, and when there is not enough signage to remind them.
      </font>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <font size='9' face='' color='White'>Rate of waste thrown in schools
      </font>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
       <font size='5' face='' color='White'>Food waste is the most commonly generated rubbish from schools. It accounted for approximately 24% of the total waste generated by schools. Food waste includes single-use plastic cups and utensils, paper and styrofoam takeout containers, and drink cans.
      </font>
      <br>
      <br>
       <font size='5' face='' color='White'>Recyclable paper products like cardboard and white and coloured paper comprised 23.5% of the total waste generated by schools. The remaining 50% of school rubbish was organic waste, such as non-recyclable paper items and leftover food.
