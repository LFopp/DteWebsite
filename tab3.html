       	Littering exists everywhere and not just in schools, however it is regulated by public cleaners and those who are caught littering are fined by the authorities, so itâ€™s not really much of an issue outside the school because it is strictly regulated. The main purpose of the outcome is mainly for the students to help them develop and be more aware and responsible of their actions.
